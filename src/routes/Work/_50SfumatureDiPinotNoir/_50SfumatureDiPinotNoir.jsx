          50 Sfumature di Pinot Noir is a prominent wine tasting event hosted
          annually in Voghera (PV), Italy.
          <br />
          <br />
          For its fifth edition, in 2024, the organizers opted for a fresh,
          modern logo to represent the event. The design I created is a sleek,
          contemporary reinterpretation of the old logo, which featured a more
          traditional and colorful aesthetic. While the original symbolized the
          variety of Pinot Noir wines through vibrant colors, the new logo
          simplifies and refines this concept by maintaining the essence of the
          event in a more elegant and timeless form.

          variations for use on different backgrounds. To enhance flexibility,

          promotional materials, and event signage. Each version was designed to
